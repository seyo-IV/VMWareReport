# Introduction #

A PowerShell based tool to make VMWare Reports in Excel.

# Setup #

## Recomendation ##
I recomend to compile an exe with ps2exe https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5.

## Requiments ##
The ImportExcel module is needed for this script. You can get it here https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ImportExcel, or install it directly for the current user with the following command `Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser`. Alternatively the script will ask you if you wish to install it, if you declide the script will stop.
